# Calculator

This app is my version of a basic calculator, developed using React with TypeScript.

This calculator is able to perform basic arithmetic operations. There is some logic to reduce syntax errors. Such as:

<ul>
  <li>Right brackets can only be inserted n(Left bracket) of times</li>
  <li>Operators can not follow each other</li>
</ul>

You can use a keyboard and input key presses to log valid entries.
AC - ESC key <br>
CE - Backspace Key <br>
Sum - Enter/Return Key <br>
Ã—(multiply) - \* Key

Press = or Enter/Return twice to have the sum of an eqaution logged into the input.

You can also use the tab key to navigate the buttons of the calculator. By using Tab + Enter/Return, Enter/Return will not evaluate the input until Enter/Return is pressed for a second time.
