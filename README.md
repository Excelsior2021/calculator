# Calculator

This app is my version of a basic calculator developed using React.

This calculator is able to perform basic arithmetic operations. There is some logic to reduce syntax errors. Such as:

<ul>
  <li>Right brackets can only be inserted n(Left bracket) of times</li>
  <li>Operators can not follow each other</li>
</ul>

You can use a keyboard and input keypresses to log valid entries.

AC - ESC key
CE - Backspace Key
Sum - Enter Key

You can also use the tab key to navigate the buttons of the calculator. By using Tab + Enter, Enter will not evaluate the input until Enter is pressed a second time.
